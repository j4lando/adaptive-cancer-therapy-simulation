# Adaptive Cancer Therapy Simulation
This is a group project for the UW's Computational Modelin in Biology class, AMATH 422. In this project we extend upon the results presented in Gallaher J.A. et al. _Spatial heterogeneity and evolutionary dynamics modulate time to recurrence in continuous and adaptive cancer therapies._ **Cancer Res.** 2018. [PMC5899666](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5899666/) by exploring the effectiveness of different treatment plans. 
## Steps
1. simplified grid based model.
2. visulization of simulation?
3. explore solution space for dynamic treatment strategy.
